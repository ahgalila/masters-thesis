\subsection{The MNIST Dataset} \label{sec:theory-approach-the-mnist-dataset}

All of our experiments use the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. This is a database of images of handwritten digits along with labels indicating the values represented. Each digit is pre-processed so that the digit is normalized and centered in a 28x28 pixel image. The digits in the images all have the same scale and orientation. The dataset consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. MNIST is very popular among researchers that need to quickly test machine learning techniques since the dataset is pre-processed \cite{MNIST}. Figure \ref{fig:noisy-mnist} shows examples of MNIST digits from zero to nine.
