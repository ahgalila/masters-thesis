\section{Thesis Outline} \label{sec:introduction-thesis-outline}

This chapter introduced the basis for our theory and the goal and strategy of our research. The following is an outline of the remaining chapters in this thesis.

Chapter 2 introduces the background knowledge that is required by the reader in order to understand the remainder of the thesis. We start Chapter 2 by introducing artificial neural networks (Section \ref{sec:background-artificial-neural-networks}), including a discussion on deep learning. Next, in Section \ref{sec:background-sequence-modeling}, a detailed explanation of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory units (LSTMs) is presented. These models form an important aspect of our empirical studies. Finally, Section \ref{sec:background-problem-local-minima} wraps up Chapter 2 by introducing the core problem that our theory is based on, that of local minima.

Chapter 3 formally lays out the hypothesis that forms the basis for our research. This is followed by an explanation of our theory development and the approach being proposed to investigate and validate this theory. 

Chapter 4 presents the empirical studies used to test and further develop the theory. Each experiment performed is detailed along with the results and a discussion of those results.

Chapter 5 is the last chapter and provides a summary of our findings and contributions. We also suggest avenues for future work.
