\section{Research Objective and Scope} \label{sec:introduction-research-objective-scope}

Our goal is to draw parallels between our understanding of how humans learn with symbols and how learning with symbols can best be applied to machine learning algorithms. The objective is to demonstrate that providing clear and concise knowledge in the form of symbols to a deep neural network can improve the effectiveness of the training process by significantly reducing the number of noisy training examples needed to produce a high level of accuracy.
