\section{Machine Learning with Neural Networks} \label{sec:introduction-introduction-machine-learning}

Designing computer systems that can model the world in such a way as to exhibit what we call intelligence requires such systems to have the ability to interpret a large number of factors. For example, if we were to develop a system that can identify and perform calculations using numbers from images of handwritten digits, the system would have to account for all the possible variations in which each digit can be written. Given the amount of data required, it would be infeasible to manually formalize solutions to these problems. Machine Learning algorithms can instead be used to automate the development of a solution by learning the important features that represent the problem domain and formalize them in a way that can then be applied to different instances of the problem\cite{Bengio:2009:LDA:1658423.1658424}.
