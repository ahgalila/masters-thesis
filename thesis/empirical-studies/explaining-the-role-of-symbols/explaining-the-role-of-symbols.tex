\section{Explaining the Role of Symbols} \label{sec:empirical-studies-explaining-the-role-of-symbols}

In the previous set of experiments we showed that our theory holds given that the models trained with the aid of symbols outperformed the models that were trained in the absence of symbols. We also showed that there was not much difference in the effectiveness of both the explicit and implicit forms of providing symbols. The next set of experiments investigate the second objective of our research which is to establish the reason why symbols improve learning in artificial neural networks. We start with an experiment that attempts to show that symbols help the artificial learner discover a general solution to the problem, similar to how they are used by humans. Based on the results, we explain the role that symbols play in the learning process.
