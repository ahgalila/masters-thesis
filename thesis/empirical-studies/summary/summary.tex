\section{Summary} \label{sec:empirical-studies-summary}

This chapter presented the experiments that were used to accomplish the objectives laid out in Section \ref{sec:theory-approach}. We were able to show that artificial neural networks, similar to human learners can benefit from the presence of clear and concise symbols when training using impoverished datasets. We were also able to explain the role symbols play in achieving this improvement. Finally, by using a more better encoding for our symbols we developed models that generalize to unseen digit combinations by discovering a representation of an algorithm that can perform the arithmetic operations. The next and final chapter provides a summary of the outcomes of our research as well as some suggestions for future work.
