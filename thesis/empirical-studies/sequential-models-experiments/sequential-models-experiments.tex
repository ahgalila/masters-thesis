\section{Sequential Models Experiments} \label{sec:empirical-studies-sequential-models-experiments}

In Section \ref{sec:theory-approach-methodology-sequential-models} we explained how basic arithmetic operations, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, can be learned using sequential models such as recurrent neural networks. We also introduced two approaches to providing symbols to neural networks while training; explicit and implicit symbols. This first set of experiments applies this sequential modeling technique to our problem of learning with symbols. We also compare the accuracies of using the two different approaches to providing symbols we discussed earlier, explicit symbols compared to implicit symbols. The overall objective of these experiments is to validate our hypothesis.
